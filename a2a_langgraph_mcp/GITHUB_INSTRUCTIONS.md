# GitHub Push and Pull Request Instructions

Since we couldn't push directly to GitHub IBM Enterprise due to authentication requirements, follow these steps to manually push the code and create a pull request:

## Step 1: Configure Git Authentication

First, ensure you have authentication set up for GitHub IBM Enterprise. You can use one of these methods:

### Option 1: Configure Git Credential Helper

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

This will store your credentials after the first successful authentication.

### Option 2: Use SSH Authentication

1. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub IBM Enterprise account.

3. Update the remote URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.ibm.com:gyliu/personal.git
   ```

## Step 2: Push Your Branch

Once authentication is configured, push your branch:

```bash
cd a2a_langgraph_mcp
git push -u origin feature/a2a-langgraph-mcp
```

## Step 3: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your GitHub IBM Enterprise repository: https://github.ibm.com/gyliu/personal

2. You should see a notification about your recently pushed branch with an option to "Compare & pull request". Click on it.

3. If you don't see the notification, you can manually create a pull request:
   - Click on "Pull requests" tab
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Set the base branch (usually "main" or "master")
   - Set the compare branch to "feature/a2a-langgraph-mcp"
   - Click "Create pull request"

4. Fill in the pull request details:
   - Title: "Add multi-agent framework based on A2A, MCP, and LangGraph"
   - Description: Copy the content from PULL_REQUEST.md

5. Click "Create pull request" to submit.

## Step 4: Review and Merge

Once the pull request is created, you or your team members can review the changes and merge them when ready.

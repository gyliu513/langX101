* Determine the primary features and functionalities required for the app
* Research existing personal finance apps to understand their strengths and weaknesses

Success criteria: Clearly defined app purpose, target audience, and primary features.

**Step 2:** Conduct market research on personal finance tracking features
* Search for articles and studies on "personal finance app features" or "best practices in personal finance app design"
* Identify essential features such as:
	+ Budgeting and expense tracking
	+ Investment tracking (e.g., stocks, bonds)
	+ Bill reminders and payment scheduling
	+ Credit score monitoring
	+ Savings goals and progress tracking
* Research popular personal finance apps (e.g., Mint, Personal Capital, YNAB) to understand their feature sets

Success criteria: List of essential features for the app.

**Step 3:** Choose a programming language and development framework
* Research popular programming languages for mobile app development (e.g., Java, Swift, Kotlin)
* Select a suitable framework for your chosen language (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Xamarin)
* Consider factors such as:
	+ Cross-platform compatibility
	+ Performance and scalability
	+ Community support and resources

Success criteria: Selected programming language and framework.

**Step 4:** Design the app's user interface and user experience
* Sketch wireframes of the app's layout and navigation
* Create a visual design concept (e.g., color scheme, typography)
* Develop a user flow diagram to illustrate how users will interact with the app

Success criteria: Wireframes and visual design concepts.

**Step 5:** Implement the app's core features using your chosen framework
* Start building the app's UI components (e.g., login screen, dashboard)
* Integrate third-party APIs for data storage and analytics (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics)
* Develop a robust backend infrastructure to handle user data and transactions

Success criteria: Functional core features.

**Step 6:** Implement advanced features such as investment tracking and credit score monitoring
* Research APIs for financial data providers (e.g., Quandl, Alpha Vantage)
* Integrate these APIs into the app's codebase
* Develop a system to handle user authentication and authorization

Success criteria: Functional advanced features.

**Step 7:** Test and iterate on the app's performance and usability
* Conduct unit testing and integration testing for individual components
* Perform UI testing and user acceptance testing (UAT) with real users
* Gather feedback and iterate on the app's design and functionality

Success criteria: App is stable, performant, and meets user expectations.

**Step 8:** Deploy the app to the App Store and Google Play Store
* Prepare a marketing plan for the app's launch

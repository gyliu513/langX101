Develop a habit of working on your own projects and don't let \"work\" mean something other people tell you to do <|file-e1290f8be28245e681bdfa5c40a7e7c4|>. Seek out the best colleagues as they can encourage you and help bounce ideas off each other and it's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones <|file-e1290f8be28245e681bdfa5c40a7e7c4|>. Husband your morale as it's crucial for doing great work and try to learn about other kinds of work by taking ideas from distant fields if you let them be metaphors <|file-e1290f8be28245e681bdfa5c40a7e7c4|>.

He emphasizes that curiosity is the best guide for finding something worth working on, and it plays a significant role in all four steps of doing great work: choosing a field, getting to the frontier, noticing gaps, and exploring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graham notes that curiosity is not something that can be commanded, but it can be nurtured and allowed to drive one's efforts. He suggests that curious people are more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place, as they cast a wide net and are more likely to stumble upon something important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graham also highlights the importance of curiosity in overcoming obstacles and staying motivated. He argues that when working on something that sparks genuine curiosity, the work will feel less burdensome, even if it's challenging. This is because curious people are driven by a desire to learn and understand, rather than just seeking external validation or rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Graham emphasizes that curiosity is a key factor in distinguishing between great work and mediocre work. He notes that people who are truly curious about their work are more likely to produce something original and innovative, whereas those who lack curiosity may simply be going through the motions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, Graham is so convinced of the importance of curiosity that he suggests it might be the single most important factor in doing great work. He even goes so far as to say that if an oracle were to give a single-word answer to the question of how to do great work, it would be \"curiosity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Paul Graham's writings suggest that curiosity is essential for doing great work, and that it plays a central role in driving innovation, creativity, and progress. By nurturing curiosity and allowing it to guide their efforts, individuals can increase their chances of producing something truly remarkable and making a meaningful contribution to their field.\n",

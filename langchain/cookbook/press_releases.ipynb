      "**Answer**: The healthcare industry is adopting generative AI tools to improve various aspects of patient care and administrative tasks. Companies like HCA Healthcare Inc, Amazon Com Inc, and Mayo Clinic have collaborated with technology providers like Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft to implement generative AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "HCA Healthcare is testing a nurse handoff tool that generates draft reports quickly and accurately, which nurses have shown interest in using. They are also exploring the use of Google's medically-tuned Med-PaLM 2 LLM to support caregivers in asking complex medical questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon Web Services (AWS) has introduced AWS HealthScribe, a generative AI-powered service that automatically creates clinical documentation. However, integrating multiple AI systems into a cohesive solution requires significant engineering resources, including access to AI experts, healthcare data, and compute capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayo Clinic is among the first healthcare organizations to deploy Microsoft 365 Copilot, a generative AI service that combines large language models with organizational data from Microsoft 365. This tool has the potential to automate tasks like form-filling, relieving administrative burdens on healthcare providers and allowing them to focus more on patient care.\n",

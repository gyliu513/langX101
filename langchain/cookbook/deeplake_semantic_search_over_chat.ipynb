In order to do so, it is necessary to specify the runtime parameter as {'tensor_db': True} during the creation of the vector store. This configuration enables the execution of queries on the Managed Tensor Database, rather than on the client side. It should be noted that this functionality is not applicable to datasets stored locally or in-memory. In the event that a vector store has already been created outside of the Managed Tensor Database, it is possible to transfer it to the Managed Tensor Database by following the prescribed steps."

    "This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of Retrieval Augumented Generation in watsonx.ai. It introduces commands for data retrieval, knowledge base building & querying, and model testing.\n",

    "## About Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a versatile pattern that can unlock a number of use cases requiring factual recall of information, such as querying a knowledge base in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index knowledge base passages (once)\n",
    "- Retrieve relevant passage(s) from knowledge base (for every user query)\n",
    "- Generate a response by feeding retrieved passage into a large language model (for every user query)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you use the sample code in this notebook, you must perform the following setup tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a [Watson Machine Learning (WML) Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-watson-machine-learning/) (a free plan is offered and information about how to create the instance can be found here).\n",
